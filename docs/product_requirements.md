Product Requirements Document (PRD)Project Name: "Val Wrapped"1. Executive SummaryA mobile-first, interactive web experience designed to go viral on TikTok/Instagram. The app gamifies the "Will you be my Valentine?" question using chaotic physics ("The Swarm"), high-end 3D aesthetics, and a shareable "Receipt" generator at the end that summarizes the user's behavior.2. User Flow (The 3-Act Structure)Act 1: The "Dreamy" Entrance (Landing)Input: User lands on URL (optional query param ?to=Name personalizes the text).Visuals: High-end 3D background (floating hearts, clouds, or soft abstract shapes). A glass-morphism card centers the screen.Action: User clicks a "Open Envelope" or "Start" button.Transition: Camera zooms into the 3D scene, overlay fades to Act 2.Act 2: The "Impossible No" (The Swarm Game)Core Loop:The question "Will you be my Valentine?" appears.Initial State: One "YES" button and one "NO" button.The Mechanic ("The Swarm"):Every time the user attempts to click/touch "NO" (and fails due to the evasion logic), a NEW "YES" button spawns from the top of the screen.These new buttons have gravity/physics—they fall and pile up at the bottom, eventually filling the screen, making the "NO" button harder to find.The "Gaslight" Text: The "NO" button text changes on every miss to "unhinged" pleas (e.g., "Really?", "I have cookies", "Don't do this", "Skill issue", "Wow.").Mobile Logic (Touch): The "NO" button uses "Teleport on Touch" (moves instantly on touchstart).Audio: A "pop" sound for every new Yes button spawned, creating a chaotic ASMR effect.Win Condition: User clicks any of the "YES" buttons (original or spawned).Tracking:startTime vs endTime (Hesitation Time).rejectionAttempts (Count of spawned buttons).Act 3: The "Love Receipt" (Viral Payoff)Transition: Confetti explosion, audio crescendo.Display: A generated "Store Receipt" styling.Content:"Customer": [Name from URL]"Item 1: Acceptance Speed" -> [Time Taken]"Item 2: Stubbornness Lvl" -> [Based on Swarm Count]"Item 3: Red Flags" -> [If Swarm Count > 10]"Total": "FOREVER"Action: "Download Receipt" button (converts HTML to Image) and "Share Link" button.3. Aesthetic & UI GuidelinesTheme: "Digital Coquette" meets "Y2K Soft".Colors:Soft Pink: #FFD1DCDeep Red: #FF004DPaper White: #FDFBF7 (for receipt)Ink Black: #1A1A1A (for receipt text)Typography:Headers: Retro Serif (e.g., 'Playfair Display' or 'Fraunces').Receipt: Monospaced (e.g., 'Courier Prime' or 'Space Mono').4. Non-Functional RequirementsPerformance: Must handle up to 50 DOM elements (buttons) without significant lag.Responsiveness: Logic must handle distinct input methods:Mouse: Vector-based repulsion.Touch: Event-based displacement.Sharing: Generated images must fit Instagram Story aspect ratio (9:16).
