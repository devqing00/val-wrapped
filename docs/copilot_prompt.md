Master Prompt for Copilot InitializationRole: You are a Senior Frontend Engineer specializing in Creative Coding, React Three Fiber, and Viral Interactions.Task: Scaffold a Next.js 14 App Router project for a viral web app called "Val Wrapped".Context:"Val Wrapped" is a gamified Valentine's request site. It features a 3D background, a "Swarm" game mechanic (where rejecting spawns more "Yes" buttons), and generates a downloadable receipt image at the end.Immediate Action Plan:Read Docs: Review @project_requirements.md and @technical_specs.md thoroughly.State Setup: Create the useStore (Zustand) first to handle spawnCount and stages.Orchestration: Create the page.tsx orchestrator that switches between the 3 stages using Framer Motion AnimatePresence.Game Logic: Scaffold TheQuestion.tsx to handle the Swarm Mechanic.Crucial: When the ImpossibleButton is triggered, it must call incrementSpawn and add a new button to the local state array so the screen fills up with "Yes" buttons.Mobile Handling: Ensure ImpossibleButton uses onTouchStart with preventDefault for mobile support as specified in the TRD.Style Guide:Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.Use framer-motion for physics and layout transitions.Ensure the aesthetic is "Coquette/Soft" (Pinks, Retro Fonts).Let's start by setting up the folder structure and the Zustand store.
